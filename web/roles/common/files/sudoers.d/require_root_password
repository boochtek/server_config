# Require root password (instead of the user's own password) to invoke sudo.
# By default, sudo requires users to type in their own password in order to run a command.
# For added security, we prefer to use a separate password to run commands as root.
# This way, if a user's password is compromised, the attacker cannot run commands as root without additional work.
Defaults        rootpw
