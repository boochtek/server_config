# The `chkconfig` command is used to set up the soft links in `/etc/rc*.d` directories,

# We prefer to use the `service` command, which provides a simple way to stop and start services.
# It's the same as running the startup scripts in `/etc/init.d` manually,
# but with a nicer interface (and better command-line completion).
# Using `service` is now the preferred way to start and stop services in most Linux distros, including RHEL.
# Debian includes the `service` command in the sysvinit-utils package.
# In Debian prior to 6.0, the `service` command was in the insserv package.

# The `mail` command line utility is not installed by default,

# It works with a wider range of mail sources, including Maildir folders, and even IMAP.
# The package also includes the `movemail` command and
# a sieve client for configuring mail filters over the SIEVE protocol.
# NOTE: This should be run after installing Postfix; otherwise, it will force `exim4` to be installed.
